Interview Problems:
 1a) Given two strings (almost identical), return the inserted character in one of the strings
      Ex) "abcd", "abcXd" -> Return 'X'
          Note: The strings have the same ordering except for the inserted character
 1b) This is the same problem, however the strings may be scrambled
      Ex) "bcda", "aXcdb" -> Return 'X'
      
 2) Return the longest possible palindrome rearrangement of a given String.
      Ex) "aba" -> "aba"
          "aebcdadcb" -> "abcdedcba"
          "adta" -> "ada" OR "ata"
          "abc" -> "a" OR "b" OR "c"
